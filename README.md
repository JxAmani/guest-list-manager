Event Guest List Manager

https://jxamani.github.io/guest-list-manager/

The **Event Guest List Manager** is a simple, browser-based app designed to help you organize guests for any event — from small parties to professional gatherings.

With a clean and intuitive interface, you can quickly add guest names, edit them, track attendance (RSVP), and remove guests if needed. Each guest is displayed with their name, RSVP status, and the time they were added. A real-time message bar provides helpful feedback as you manage the list.

The app is fast, lightweight, and runs entirely in the browser — no accounts, no databases, just an easy way to keep your guest list under control.


 How to Use

1. Enter a guest's name and click "Add a guest".
2. Use the buttons next to each guest to:
   - Edit their name
   - Mark as Attending or Not Attending
   - Remove them from the list
3. You can manage up to 10 guests at a time.
